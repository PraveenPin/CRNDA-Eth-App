Async Storage
-----------------------
For mobile apps, if you need to store some data on your app.
We can use "Async Storage" for storing simple storage.
"Async Storage" is a persistent key/value storage and for more complex data we can use blockchain itself.

App Store Optimisation
---------------------------
1. App Icon - See Expo documentation on app icons.
2. Splash Screen
3. Valid Bundle Identifier for ios or android package
4. Version number
5. Privacy Policy
6. Follow iOS guidelines, android permissions ( we can limit permissions in app.json file )

Reason for rejections - iOS
--------------------------
1. Crashes and bugs -> Test thoroughly
2. Requesting arbitrary permissions on android or iOS
3. Broken Links
4. Substandart Interface


Release Channel
--------------------
Allow us to keep production app running, and so we can simultaneously test OTA the update without publishing.
